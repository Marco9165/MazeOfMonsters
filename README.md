# MazeOfMonsters
This game, "Maze of Monsters," was developed collaboratively by Marco Brito and Pedro Pinto as a project for the course "Laboratórios de Informática II" at the University of Minho. The game was created using the C programming language, showcasing the team's programming skills and knowledge.

"Maze of Monsters" is an exciting roguelite-style game where you explore a randomly generated maze, face off against monsters, and search for treasures. Each playthrough is unique due to the procedural generation of the maze and encounters with enemies. Death is permanent, resetting the game from the beginning, which encourages strategy and careful planning. Your goal is to survive in a cave filled with challenges, using weapons, potions, and strategy to find the key that unlocks the door and escape the maze. Explore, defeat powerful enemies and collect valuable items to strengthen your character. Each playthrough offers a new adventure filled with dangers and rewards.
